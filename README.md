# nominatim-rs
Rust API bindings for the [nominatim] reverse geocoding API.

I've tried to keep this library simple and accessible for beginners so you can
easily use it in your own projects. If you are looking for a new feature or
notice a bug open a PR or issue on the [Github repository][github] and I'll try
to get to it as quickly as possible.
